All colors must be typed in in lowercase.

Only supports single color and artifact currently.

Supported colors:
- Red
- Green
- Blue
- Black
- White
- Artifact
- Default - default color if none is entered, kind of pinkish.

Simply open the index.html in any browser and you are away.

Its very barebones, you have to manually add the text into the fields
currently, but looking at getting that updated with buttons.
